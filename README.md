## My process

Worked on Mobile first approach, then added media queries, adjusting the layout.
Used Bootstrap for layout and Gulp task runner for automating tasks in this project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM Methodology
- SASS
- Bootstrap
- Gulp

### What I learned

Learned how to use Gulp task runner to automate tasks like compiling sass, applying vendor prefixes, minifying css, transpile js into backwards compatible version of js which can run on old browsers.
Creating accessible toggle button using button, checkbox and radio buttons.
Splitting SASS to multiple files in an organized way by creating folders for different purposes.

### Continued development

Will continue to work more on SASS and complete the bonus challenge for this project which is to create the same existing effect without any js. Also learn React and use it for future projects.
